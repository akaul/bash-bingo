## Bash Bingo!

A fun way to learn bash commands!

### How to play

1. Use the `make_board.rb` script to generate boards. Each player should have at
   least one board. The odds of having a winner will be higher if you give each
   person multiple boards. Print out boards.
1. For facilitator: Use `bash-bingo.key` if you can, since it has answers in the
   speaker notes. If you want to figure it out all together, use the PDF.
